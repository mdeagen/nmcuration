# Weibull Plot Extraction Guide 

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on extracting data from Weibull plots using the [WebPlotDigitizer](https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/). 


## Introduction

Dielectric breakdown tests measure the cumulative probability of failure as a function of electric field. Insulator materials tend to break down under electrical stress in a statistical manner following a Weibull distribution. As a result, Weibull plots are commonly used in research articles to present experimental data in the Results section.

The x-axis in a Weibull plot (usually) follows a logarithmic scale. The y-axis is scaled by *ln(-ln(1-p))*, where *p* is the cumulative probability of failure.

While the WebPlotDigitizer allows for logarithmic axis calibration, the tool **does not** include Weibull axis calibration. Therefore, we must extract the data as a **linear** scale, then convert to probability ourselves.


## Linear Calibration of Weibull y-axis

In most Weibull plots, the y-axis label is the probability of failure. These values of the dependent variable (cumulative probability) are the numeric values we want to extract as a function of the independent variable (Electric field, typically in units of kV/mm). [**Note:** 1 kV/mm = 1 V/Î¼m = MV/m]

Here is a conversion table between y-axis labels (probabilities) and the linearized value. When calibrating the axis, type the value from the right hand column corresponding to the appropriate label. 

| Weibull  y-axis label | ln(-ln(1-p)) |
|-------|--------------|
| 99.9 | 1.933 |
| 99 | 1.527 |
| 90 | 0.834 |
| 80 | 0.476 |
| 70 | 0.186 |
| 60 | -0.087 |
| 50 | -0.367 |
| 40 | -0.672 |
| 30 | -1.031 |
| 20 | -1.5 |
| 10 | -2.25 |
| 5 | -2.97 |
| 1 | -4.6 |


In the below example, where y-axis calibration labels are 1 and 99, you would type -4.6 and 1.527 respectively, and keep as a *linear scale*.

## Extraction of Data

Once the axes have been calibrated, use auto-extract or manual extraction to capture the x-y data. **Copy these data to the clipboard**.

Paste these data into the X column of the `Weibull_converter.xlsx` Excel spreadsheet ([link to download](https://github.com/mdeagen/nmcuration/blob/master/weibull/www/Weibull_converter.xlsx)). While the pasted rows are highlighted, use *Data* > *Text to columns* > *Comma delimited* to convert the .csv data into two columns, X and Y. The converted values will appear in the columns to the right, as in the below example.

Before proceeding, perform a visual spot-check that the extracted datapoints correspond to what is visually presented in the plot. For example, the above example **fails** because the y-axis appears to have some scaling other than ln(-ln(1-p)). **See "Alternate y-axis Scaling" section below.**

If the extracted data pass visual inspection, **confirm that the x-axis units are correct** and copy the converted data into its own separate file (including column headers) and name the file with the corresponding sample ID (e.g., `S1_weibull.xlsx`).


## Entering Weibull Data into Schema Excel Template

In sheet "`5.3 Properties-Electrical`" of the Excel template, ensure that the correct filename is placed in cell `C27`. When the mapping code creates a sub-directory for a given sample, ensure that a copy of the file (e.g., `S1_weibull.xlsx`) is included in that sub-directory.

## Uploading Curated Data into NanoMine

When curating a sample fileset into NanoMine, include the Weibull data as an attachment.


# Alternate y-axis Scaling

Some plotting software may distort the y-axis of output plots with an additional power law term, such as ln(-ln(1-p^n)), where n is a positive number. Such scaling is found in Weibull plots by Grabowski *et al.*, where n = 0.08.

Below is a table with the linearized y-axis scale values for this alternate scaling.

| Weibull  y-axis label | ln(-ln(1-p^0.08)) |
|---|---|
| 99 | 1.964 |
| 90 | 1.565 |
| 50 | 1.072 |
| 10 | 0.578 |
| 1 | 0.163 |

The linearized scale would use values from this table instead, such as 0.163 and 1.964 shown below.

The acquired data using this alternate scale calibration can then be copied to the clipboard.

Because we added a power term (n), converting back to probabilities will need to account for this term:

>p = (1 - e^(-e^y))^(1/n)).

An Excel file for converting Grabowski *et al.* where n = 0.08 has been added to this repo (`Weibull_converter_altscale1.xlsx`, download [here](https://github.com/mdeagen/nmcuration/blob/master/weibull/www/Weibull_converter_altscale1.xlsx)).

Upon inspection, these data match those values reported on the plot much more closely and may be curated into NanoMine.
