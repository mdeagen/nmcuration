# "Stalled" Curation Projects
This directory is intended for curation progress that have reached an internal or external roadblock and are **no longer actively in progress** until a requested fix has been implemented.

Move a sub-directory for a publication to this directory after:
* The sub-directory has resided in the "In-Progress" directory
* A best effort has been made to curate the data from the paper
* A roadblock was reached and a description of the roadblock has been added to the README.md file (along with proposed fix, if applicable)

If a fix has been made, note in the README.md for that sub-directory and return the sub-directory to the "In Progress" directory.
