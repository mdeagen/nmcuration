* Fig 3a,b: Stress-strain (note samples not labeled in 3a)
* Fig 4a-b,d: Mechanical characterization (note b-d have dual y-axes) vs mass/volume fraction (reported as %)
* Fig 5: Melting enthalpy
* Fig 11: Degree of crystallinity vs. strain (plus elongation at yield)

## Events

2020-06-05: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest

2020-06-08: Added datasets from AFRL collaborators (M.E.D.)
* Not all of these datasets will be used, but "Datasets of Interest" should be among these
* `.opj` is only openable with Origin (freely available [Origin Viewer](https://www.originlab.com/viewer/) can be used to read these)
* Should convert relevant tabular datasets to `.csv` for processing

2020-06-08: Added master excel file for data curation (H.D.)
* Currently an initial draft covering the overall information
* This excel file can be used as a starting point for each of the following samples
* `Koerner_2005_Polymer_Master.xlsx`

2020-06-12: Added Tidy Table and updated master excel file (H.D.)
* The initial draft of the Tidy Table is included with all inflormation in one location
* The master excel file has been updated (`Koerner_2005_Polymer_Master.xlsx`)
* `Koerner_2005_Polymer_Tidy_Table.xlsx`

2020-06-15: Meeting to discuss curation items (M.E.D., H.D.)
* Schema does not currently have a term for "stress/elongation at onset of strain hardening" (in this paper, this term is distinct from "stress at yield")
* For now, ignore strain hardening term, and only include stress and strain at yield for Figs 4, 11
* Keep these data in the Tidy Table in case schema is expanded
* Updated Datasets of Interest for Fig 4, 11

2020-06-15: Moved curation job to "In-Progress" (M.E.D.)

2020-07-17: Updated Tidy Table and added "Additional Data" (H.D.)
* Added new folder with Additional Data
* Updated Tidy Table with additional data file names included
