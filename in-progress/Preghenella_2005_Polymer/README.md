## Datasets of Interest

> DGEBA-based epoxy nanocomposites filled with various amounts of fumed silica nanopowders (10, 20 and 30 phr corresponding to 3.3, 6.4 and 9.2% by volume)
* Only need to enter volume fraction (mass fraction will be calculated by ChemProps)
* Fig 1: Tg vs silica content (note above phr to vol% conversion) where Tg measured by DSC analysis (see Issue 1)
* Fig 3: Stress-strain data
* Table 2: Silica phr (convert to vol%), Elastic modulus (MPa), Stress at yield/break (MPa), Strain at yield/break (Percent)
* Fig 7: Storage modulus vs. Temperature
* Fig 9: Tan delta vs. Temperature
* Table 4: Tg and peak tan delta as measured by DMA (see Issue 1)

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Tg is reported from both DSC and DMA characterization. Which values to import, and how to specify which data came from which characterization method?

**Workaround:** For now, just import the DMA Tg data, as this is the most sensitive (see [here](https://www.intertek.com/blog/2013-04-15-glass-transition-temperature/)).

### Issue 2

> Critical energy release rate and apparent fracture toughness (Fig. 4) are not accommodated by current version of schema.
