# "In-Progress" Curation Projects
This directory is intended for curation progress that are **actively in progress**.

Move a sub-directory for a publication to this directory after:
* A sub-directory has been created in the "Wishlist" directory
* All raw data has been obtained (in the event that the curator is working with the author(s) of the paper)
* Figures/data of interest to NanoMine have been identified and added to the README.md in the sub-directory
* If moving the sub-directory from the "Stalled" or "Revisited" directories, ensure that the issue has been documented in the README.md of the sub-directory

Once all template files and supplementary files have been added to NanoMine (QA), and a "Success!" report has been returned for each fileset, move the sub-directory to the "Completed" directory.

If the curation process reaches a significant roadblock, add a description to the README.md file and move the sub-directory to the "Stalled" directory.
