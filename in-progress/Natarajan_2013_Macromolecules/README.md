## Events

2020-06-09: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)

2020-06-10: Added data of interest (M.E.D.)
* Issue 1 and Issue 2 require resolution before data can be uploaded to NanoMine

2020-06-10: Moved curation job to "In-Progress" (M.E.D.)

2020-06-11: Added master_template_DOI, Samples_DOI and Mapping.py (D.J.)

2020-06-11: Added Images subdirectory containing microstructure photos (D.J.)

2020-06-11: Searched Natarajan thesis for absolute Tg values (D.J., M.E.D.)
* Fig 2.11 shows example DSC curve indicating Tg of 109.56 deg C for neat PMMA
* Did not find raw data for average Tg
* No DSC curves provided for other polymers of interest (PS, P2VP, PEMA)
* Will assemble and use reference table of Tg values from the literature in order to infer experimental Tg from delta-Tg values

2020-06-11: Compiled and added reference table for Tg from literature (M.E.D.)
* PS: Tg = 100 C
* PMMA: Tg = 105 C
* P2VP: Tg = 100 C
* PEMA: Tg = 65 C
* Note: PMMA Tg differs from example DSC curve of Fig 2.11 of thesis, but will

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> How are particle surface energy values stored in the schema? Surface treatment of particles is an integral component of this work to control dispersion of nanoparticles by tuning surface energy.

### Issue 2

> The author reported all values of glass transition temperature (Tg) as relative values (Î”Tg), but did not provide the Tg of the reference control samples (neat polymers). Some additional inference is required in order to input these data in the schema.
