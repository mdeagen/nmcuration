## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> How are particle surface energy values stored in the schema? Surface treatment of particles is an integral component of this work to control dispersion of nanoparticles by tuning surface energy.

### Issue 2

> The author reported all values of glass transition temperature (Tg) as relative values (Î”Tg), but did not provide the Tg of the reference control samples (neat polymers). Some additional inference is required in order to input these data in the schema.
