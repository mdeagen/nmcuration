## Events

2020-06-02: (Virtually) added publication, curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)

2020-06-04: Added job to "In-Progress" (M.E.D.)

2020-06-04: Made updates to R code (M.E.D.)
* Updated column headers for supplementary datafiles
* Changed datafile export from .csv to .xlsx (NOTE: This causes a SIGNIFICANT increase in execution time compared to the efficient `write_csv` function)
* Various edits for NA handling related to R 4.0 changes
* This R code is less efficient than later iterations that used left_join to assemble the dataframe

2020-06-04: Ran R code to generate sample filesets (M.E.D.)
