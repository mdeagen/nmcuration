## Events

2020-06-16: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1 related to Weibull raw data extraction
* Added Issue 2 related to schema

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)

### Issue 2

> How to represent material state (e.g. Temperature)... and at what point does this become a different "sample"?
