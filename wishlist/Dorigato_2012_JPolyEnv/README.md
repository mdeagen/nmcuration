## Datasets of Interest

* Table 1: Particle diameter for different types of SiO2 fillers used in study
* Fig 2: DSC data
* Table 2: Tg, Tm, Degree of crystallization (from first heating, see Issue 1)
* Fig3a-c: Stress-strain (note vol% is encoded in the corresponding label of each curve)
* Table 3: Tensile modulus, stress at yield, stress at break, elongation at break
* Fig 4a-d: Same attributes as in Table 3, however only for A380 and Ar805 filler plus additional vol%'s
* Table 5: Tensile impact strength, elongation at break

## Events

2020-07-22: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Table 2 has data corresponding to first heating, cooling, and second heating.

**Workaround:** For now, ignore data from  cooling and 2nd heating
