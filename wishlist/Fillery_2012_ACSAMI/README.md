## Events

2020-06-19: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1 related to Weibull raw data extraction

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)

### Issue 2

> How to accommodate both SAXS and WAXS data for a given sample (Excel schema template has only one placeholder for "Xray diffraction and scattering")
