## Events

2020-06-05: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest

2020-06-08: Added datasets from AFRL collaborators (M.E.D.)
* Not all of these datasets will be used, but "Datasets of Interest" should be among these
* `.opj` is only openable with Origin (freely available [Origin Viewer](https://www.originlab.com/viewer/) can be used to read these)
* Should convert relevant tabular datasets to `.csv` for processing

2020-06-08: Added master excel file for data curation (H.D.)
* Currently an initial draft covering the overall information
* This excel file can be used as a starting point for each of the following samples
* `Koerner_2005_Polymer_Master.xlsx`

2020-06-12: Added Tidy Table and updated master excel file (H.D.)
* The initial draft of the Tidy Table is included with all inflormation in one location
* The master excel file has been updated (`Koerner_2005_Polymer_Master.xlsx`)
* `Koerner_2005_Polymer_Tidy_Table.xlsx`
