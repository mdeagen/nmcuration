## Events

2020-06-05: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest

2020-06-08: Added datasets from AFRL collaborators (M.E.D.)
* Not all of these datasets will be used, but "Datasets of Interest" should be among these
* `.opj` is only openable with Origin (freely available [Origin Viewer](https://www.originlab.com/viewer/) can be used to read these)
* Should convert relevant tabular datasets to `.csv` for processing
