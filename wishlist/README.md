# Curation Project "Wishlist"
This directory is intended for nascent curation jobs, and specifically to pre-process these jobs before they are moved to "In-Progress".

Before moving a project to the "In-Progress" directory:
* Create a sub-directory for the curation job
* Create a Traveler README.md (see below for instructions)
* Identify datasets of interest (including Figure/Table number where applicable)
* If in communication with the author(s), request and obtain raw datasets where applicable

## Creating the "Traveler" for a Curation Project (README.md)
Analogous to a *manufacturing traveler*, this document will accompany the curation project throughout its journey from "Wishlist" to "Completed."

The format of the traveler is a `README.md` markdown file located in the sub-directory for the curation project. The purpose of this file is to document key steps in the curation process (e.g., moving the project between curation stages), as well as any issues/roadblocks encountered along the way. Documentation of issues and roadblocks is valuable information that will help the team continue to improve and streamline the curation process.

An example format for the Traveler (in markdown format) is:

## Requesting Raw Datasets from Authors
Raw datasets that generated a figure are preferred over manual/digital extraction of the data from an image of the figure. Requests to the corresponding author of the paper should be made through the NanoMine email alias (contact Marc Palmeri at marc.j.palmeri`at`duke.edu for assistance in composing and sending the first email correspondence).

The corresponding author of a publication, whose contact information is included on either the first or last page of a published article, is typically the leader of the lab that produced the publication. Requests should be respectful of the author's time and specific to the datasets of interest to NanoMine, with the realization that the raw datasets may not have been archived in a repository. The corresponding author may direct you to contact the lead author of the paper, who may or may not still be a member of the research group.
