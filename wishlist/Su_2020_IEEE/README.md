## Events

2020-06-11: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1,2 related to schema

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Do we have schema term for current density vs. E field, which would be stored as a property curve for a given sample?

### Issue 2

> How to model mobility vs. E field as a function of discrete temperatures? How do we store the "state" of a material, without it becoming a new "sample"? Or, should each point in a plot such as Fig 14 be considered a separate sample (even though they are from the same experimental unit)?
