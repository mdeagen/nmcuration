## Bibliographic Info

* DOI: 10.1017/S1431927616010126

## Datasets of Interest

* Note: some of these samples are hairy nanoparticle assemblies, hence they have particle surface treatment but no "matrix" (see Issue 1)
* Fig 1 (Table): NP fraction (volume fraction, see Issue 2), graft density, Tg
* Fig 2: TEM images

## Events

2020-06-22: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1 related to schema
* Added Issue 2 related to lack of reported units

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> These are assemblies of hairy nanoparticles (no "matrix" in conventional sense). How to represent this geometry?

### Issue 2

> Author does not report units on fraction of NPs.

**Workaround:** Searched other works from this author, found same unitless fraction. By default, assume **volume** fraction based on similar works from co-authors (such as Jiao).
