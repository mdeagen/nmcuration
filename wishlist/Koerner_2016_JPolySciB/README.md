## Datasets of Interest

* Note: These samples do not contain a matrix (see Issue 1), but are compared to neat PS
* Table 1: SiO2 vol%, graft density, Tg, degree of polymerization of grafted chain (see Issue 2)
* Fig 2e,f: SAXS data
* Fig 3a: same Tg data as Table 1, but not rounded to nearest integer

## Events

2020-06-19: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1,2 related to schema/ontology expansion

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> These are assemblies of hairy nanoparticles (no "matrix" in conventional sense). How to represent this geometry?

### Issue 2

> Expand ontology to include degree of polymerization
