## Events

2020-06-18: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1 related to schema
* Added Issue 2 related to Weibull raw data extraction

2020-07-20: Fixed DOI in Traveler (M.E.D.)

2020-07-24: Added Weibull Plot Converter (H.D.)
* Included new excel file with all Weibull plot values converted

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Filler comprises SiC/SiO2 core/shell particles... how to represent geometry? Dimensions of core/shell are important to this study.

### Issue 2

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)
