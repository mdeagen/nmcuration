## Datasets of Interest

* Note: some of these samples are hairy nanoparticle assemblies, hence they have particle surface treatment but no "matrix" (see Issue 1)
* Fig 2g,h: SAXS data
* Fig 3a,b: dielectric permittivity (at 1 kHz) vs. vol frac (see Issue 2)
* Fig 3c: dielectric (imaginary permittivity) loss vs. Frequency (see Issue 2)
* Fig 4: Weibull data (see Issue 3)
* Fig 5: Breakdown strength vs. vol fraction

## Events

2020-06-19: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1,2 related to schema and curation
* Added Issue 3 related to Weibull raw data extraction

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> These are assemblies of hairy nanoparticles (no "matrix" in conventional sense). How to represent this geometry?

### Issue 2

> Dielectric permittivity data is sometimes provided at a single frequency. How to curate this condition in machine-interpretable form? If provided a single value and a spectrum, how to incorporate both?


### Issue 3

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)
