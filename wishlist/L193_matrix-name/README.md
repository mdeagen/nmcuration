## Curation Issue?

The Standard Chemical Name *tetraglycidyl 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane* is listed as the matrix material, along with a *triglycidyl para-aminophenol* counterpart, which seem to be unique to one set of samples.

Check DOI (10.1021/nn100661a)[http://doi.org/10.1021/nn100661a] to confirm samples were curated properly.

From Experimental section of paper:

>Materials: High-performance epoxy systems were prepared by mixing a low-viscosity resin (triglycidyl of para-aminophenol, Araldite MY0510, Huntsman) and a high-viscosity resin (tetraglycidyl 4,4=-diaminodiphenyl methane, Araldite MY721, Huntsman) at different mass ratios with a diamine hardener (3,3=- diaminodiphenyl sulfone, (3,3=)-DDS, Aradur 9719-1, Huntsman). Resin mixtures ranged from 0 to 100 wt % MY721 with increments of 25 wt % MY721. The ratio of H equivalents in the diamine to epoxide equivalents was kept constant at 0.778:1 (as recommended by the manufacturer) in order to minimize variations in extent of cure for different  resin blends. Carbon nanofibers (GANF1, Grupo Antolı´n Ingenierı´a) produced by Nicatalyzed carbon vapor deposition with 20200 nm diameters, 16 m lengths, and 35:1 aspect ratio were used as received. For each resin ratio, both a neat (0 wt % CNF) sample and nanocomposite with 1 part per hundred resin (phr), or 0.68 wt %, of CNFs were prepared.


Should this instead be categorized as an **epoxy resin**??
