Abstract:
>Functionalisation of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) influences the thermo-
>mechanical properties of MWCNT/epoxy-composites. Samples based on epoxy resin and
>different weight percentage of MWCNTs (functionalised and non-functionalised) were

>mechanic thermal analysis (DMTA). A dependence of the nanotube content on the glass
>transition temperature T g was observed. An increase in the amount of nanotubes led to an â€¦


### Issue

Abstract mentions functionalization of MWCNTs, however there is no "ParticleSurfaceTreatment" information on these samples.
