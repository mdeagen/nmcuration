## Datasets of Interest

* Note: some of these samples are hairy nanoparticle assemblies, hence they have particle surface treatment but no "matrix" (see Issue 1)
* Table 1: sample list, Sio2 vol fraction, graft density
* Fig 3: Dielectric permittivity (real, imaginary) at 100 kHz (see Issue 2) vs. SiO2 vol%
* Fig 4: Dielectric loss (tan delta) at 1 kHz (see Issue 2) vs. SiO2 vol%
* Fig 5: Breakdown strength vs. SiO2 vol%
* Fig S1: USAXS data
* Fig S2: Dielectric spectra (see Issue 2)
* Fig S3: Weibull data (see Issue 3)
* Fig S4: Weibull data (see Issue 4)

## Events

2020-06-19: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1,2 related to schema and curation
* Added Issue 3 related to Weibull raw data extraction

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> These are assemblies of hairy nanoparticles (no "matrix" in conventional sense). How to represent this geometry?

### Issue 2

> Dielectric permittivity data is sometimes provided at a single frequency. How to curate this condition in machine-interpretable form? If provided a single value and a spectrum, how to incorporate both?


### Issue 3

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)
