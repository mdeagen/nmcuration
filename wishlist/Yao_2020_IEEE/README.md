## Datasets of Interest

* Fig 4: DSC curves, Tg values
* Fig 5a: Thermal conductivity vs composition (provided as BN:AlN ratio, would need to convert x-axis to actual filler loading)
* Fig 6: Dielectric (loss) spectra vs. Temperature, Frequency
* Fig 7: Weibull data (note that y-axis scale is linearized by Weibull distribution)

## Events

2020-06-18: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1 related to schema
* Added Issue 2 related to Weibull raw data extraction

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Filler comprises nano-BN anchored to micro-AlN particles... how to represent? BN and AlN were individually treated with particle surface treatments PDA and EPOPTMS. Can there be more than one particle surface treatment within a given sample in the XML schema representation?

### Issue 2

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)
