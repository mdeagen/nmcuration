## Datasets of Interest

* Table 1: DSC data - Tg, Cp (specific heat capacity), Tm (melting temp - use 1 or 2), deltaHm (heat of fusion)
* Fig 7a-b: Dielectric loss (imaginary component of diel. permittivity) vs. frequency at 75C and -60C (see Issue 1)

## Events

2020-08-10: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest

## Open Issues

### Issue 1
>Fig 7a-b are AC dielectric dispersion data, but at different temperatures. Rather than split into separate samples, can copy cells `A15:F22` in sheet `5.2 Properties-Electrical` of template and paste as extra rows below. "Test Conditions - Temperature" field will be filled out with the corresponding temperature, and the "Loss permittivity" row, "Datafile" column will contain the filename of the tabular datafile extracted from Fig 7 for the respective sample at the respective temperature.
