## Datasets of Interest

* Note: some of these samples are hairy nanoparticle assemblies, hence they have particle surface treatment but no "matrix" (see Issue 1)
* Fig 1d-g: TEM images
* Table 1: SiO2 vol%, graft density, Tg
* Fig 2a: Weibull data (see Issue 3)
* Fig 2b: Dielectric breakdown strength (note units of V/um) (see Issue 2) vs. aging time (see Issue 4)
* Fig 2c: Weibull shape parameter vs. aging time (see Issue 4)
* Fig 3: Dielectric breakdown strength and Weibull shape parameter

## Events

2020-06-22: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1,2 related to schema and curation
* Added Issue 3 related to Weibull raw data extraction
* Added Issue 4 related to curation

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> These are assemblies of hairy nanoparticles (no "matrix" in conventional sense). How to represent this geometry?

### Issue 2

> Dielectric permittivity data is sometimes provided at a single frequency. How to curate this condition in machine-interpretable form? If provided a single value and a spectrum, how to incorporate both?


### Issue 3

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)

### Issue 4

> Note that aging time is a key process parameter
