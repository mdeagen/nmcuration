## Datasets of Interest

* Table 1: codes used to label sample types (and corresponding wt%)
* Table 3: Tg, Tm, enthalpy of fusion (from DSC characterization)
* Fig 13: Storage modulus vs. Temperature
* Fig 14: Loss modulus vs. Temperature
* Table 5: Tg (from DMA characterization) (see Issue 1)
* Fig 15: Stress-strain curves

## Events

2020-07-22: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Paper reports Tg from two types of characterization methods

**Workaround:** While DMA is generally more accurate for determining Tg, still include DSC data, but curate as separate samples (even though the labels are the same)

## Closed Issues
