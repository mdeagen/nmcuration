## Datasets of Interest

* Note: some of these samples are hairy nanoparticle assemblies, hence they have particle surface treatment but no "matrix" (see Issue 1)
* Table 1: molecular weight (kDa), polydispersity (Mw/Mn), graft density (chains/nm^2), NP loading (vol%)
* Fig 3: TEM images
* Fig 5a: Elastic modulus vs. molecular weight (note vol% NPs) compared to neat matrix (PS)
* Fig 6a: Yield stress vs. molecular weight (nots vol% NPs) compared to neat matrix (PS)
