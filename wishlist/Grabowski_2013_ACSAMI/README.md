## Events

2020-06-19: Added curation job to "Wishlist" (M.E.D.)
* Added list of datasets of interest
* Added Issue 1 related to schema and curation
* Added Issue 2 related to Weibull raw data extraction

## Open Issues

### Issue 1

> Dielectric permittivity data is sometimes provided at a single frequency. How to curate this condition in machine-interpretable form? If provided a single value and a spectrum, how to incorporate both?

### Issue 2

> Would be helpful to have tool for digitally extracting Weibull plot data (appropriately scaled y-axis)
