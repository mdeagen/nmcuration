## Datasets of Interest

* Note: CP2-g-VGCNF indicates "grafted" surface treatment on CNFs; otherwise, without surface treatment is referred to as CP2/VGCNF blend
* Fig 6: DSC data, with respective Tg values labeled on chart
* Table 6,7: Tensile strength (tensile stress at yield), tensile modulus, tensile strain (although "tensile strain" is not a property, appears to be jargon for elongation at break)
