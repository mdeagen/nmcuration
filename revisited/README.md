# "Revisited" Curation Projects
This directory is intended for curation progress that were **previously in the NanoMine system** but require some correction 

Move a sub-directory for a pproject to this directory after:
* The sub-directory has resided in the "Completed" directory
* An issue has been identified for the curated publication

The purpose of this directory is to **document the issue with the original curated publication** and describe any steps to be taken in the README.md for the sub-directory.

Once the issues have been sufficiently documented, the sub-directory may be returned to the "In Progress" directory.
